Q backlog
-Admin interface
A- put the new activities only in the database file

-I want to connect to the server to play with other people
A- if you want multiple instances of the same server then the client needs to choose which server to use
-- Do not hard code the server in the client

Q merge requests
-Too much time for approval
A- use the judge system to provide feedback

-Check and fix pipeline in main
A- before you merge the issue branch you should merge main into your branch and run all the tests
--Merge regularly

Q tests
-Tests for common is not urgent so we could add tests later, but we should test everything in backend immediatelly
A- you should not test something that interacts with fxml stuff but you should put all the logic methods not in the controller class,
 but in a seperate class that you should later test

## Description of project
this application provides a small quiz to test people's awareness of energy consumption. Our goal is for
players to answer different kinds of questions about energy consumption, and use jokers and
emojis to interact with other players during gameplay.

## Preventing and handling errors
If there are no players in the database, you can not open the all-time leaderboard

The image path is different for all the images, depending on your machine. So if you are using WINDOWS you should let them as they are, but if you are using, for example, macOS add "@../../path" at the beginning of the image file path.

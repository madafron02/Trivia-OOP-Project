- The workflow will remain the same, we will directly merge to main.

- We do not need at this moment a development branch.

- We need to be more active and merge the branches more quickly.

- Add checkboxes if is possible for the issues.

- Comment the issue so the other people will have a better idea over what you have done or what you have to do.

- Gitignore!

- Focus on tests!
